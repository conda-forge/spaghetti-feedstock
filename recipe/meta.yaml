  description: |
    Spaghetti is an open-source Python library for the analysis
    of network-based spatial data. Originating from the network 
    module in [PySAL](http://pysal.org) (Python Spatial Analysis Library), 
    it is under active development for the inclusion of 
    newly-proposed methods for building graph-theoretic 
    networks and the analysis of network events.
